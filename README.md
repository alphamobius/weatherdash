# weatherdash
weather dash. for use in home or in a car dash to give a quick weather report once. 


The goal is to get baseMapEmbedded.html underneath the wunderground gif link for the animated radar.
mapsJS.html is the current non-working prototype

Follow-on goal is to use variables for the GPS coordinates in all API calls, so those variables can be tied to a GPS reciever.
